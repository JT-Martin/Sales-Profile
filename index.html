                    <p>2 Comma Club Award Winner</p>
                    <p>Founder of:</p>

                    </ul>
                    <p>I worked for Dino for nearly 2 years selling his Funnel Consultant Society coaching program over Zoom calls and we mainly closed appointments generated through a mixture of Facebook ads, YouTube ads and long term email marketing campaigns.</p>
                    <p>I started off working for Dino part-time but transitioned into working for him full-time as the main closer of the company in addition to occasionally coaching and giving advice to his mastermind clients in regards to sales and closing.</p>
                    <p>I started off closing about 15% of the appointments where people showed up but managed to increase it to an average of about 30% and my best month I closed at 36.8%.</p>

                    <h3 class="name">Todd Schuchart</h3>
                    <p>Founder of YouInLocal.com</p>
                    <p>I worked for Todd for only a few months in 2021 selling his lead generation program for Life Insurance Agents in the US. My responsibilities were mainly to handle sales appointments that were generated for me by the company and then to follow up with anyone who didn't purchase immediately</p>
                    <p>After a couple months of working for Todd I realized I could generate more appointments for myself by hiring an assistant appointment setter so that is what I did. I spent a couple weeks interviewing and testing different applicants I'd found through Upwork.com and eventually hired someone.</p>
                    <p>I then spent the next 2 months training her as she learnt to cold call insurance agents and set appointments with them to speak with me.</p> <p>On average she was generating qualified appointments for me at a total average cost of about $50 USD each.</p>
                    <p>I was happy with the cost considering she was only working for me part time and I was paying her a premium because of her experience.</p>
                    <p>If I hired her full-time I think we could have got the cost to around $40/appointment and if I hired someone with less experience and trained them up with the SOP's I built out it could have been more like $25-30/appointment.</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately after only a short few months of working for Todd he decided to shut the business down to focus on his new business but we parted ways amicably.</p>

                        <li>- Maverick Growth Agency</li>
                        <li>- LeadLaunch(formerly known as MBA Training)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>I have been working for Zane since late October 2021 as the Sales Coach for his MBA program, this has given me the chance to educate students on: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>- Setting appointments with potential clients using multiple different methods like cold email, cold calls and social media.</li>
                        <li>- Structuring sales calls in terms of what questions to ask, what to say and what to show them to get them to turn into a client.</li>
                        <li>- How to manage client relationships in terms of expectations and structuring deals.</li>
                        <li>- How to construct an irresistable offer.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>All of the students I've worked with have greatly appreciated my help and have managed to see dramatic shifts in their results in terms of reaching out to potential clients and setting up appointments with them.</p>
                    <p>I have also hired, trained and managed an appointment setter for MBA Training who handles all of the initial triage calls before they spoke with either myself or Zane so we could close them.</p>
                    <p>In terms of sales I did 119 sales meetings over 8 months with people who actually showed up and closed 25 of them(average of 21% close rate) on our coaching program with prices ranging from $4900 up to $9600 with a mix between paid in full payments, split payments and 12-36 month financing.</p>
                    <p>Most of the people I spoke with only found out about us a few days before the meeting through Facebook/YouTube ads but they had completed applications and spoken with Jenny beforehand.</p>
